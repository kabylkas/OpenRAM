\label{sec:gdsMill_permission}

OpenRAM uses gdsMill, a GDS library written by Michael Wieckowski at
the University of Michigan. Michael gave us complete permission to use
the code. Since then, we have made several bug and performance
enhancements to gdsMill. In addition, gdsMill is no longer available
on the web, so we distribute it along with OpenRAM.
